# Keke Fieye – HTML Recipe Assignment

A simple, standards‑compliant recipe page built for an AltSchool assignment. It demonstrates basic HTML structure, semantics, lists, images, and text formatting using an authentic Ijaw recipe (Keke Fieye).

## Live Demo
- Public page: https://ikemike01.github.io/html-recipe/recipe.html

## What this showcases
- Valid HTML5 document (doctype, head/meta/title, body)
- Semantic structure: header, main, article, section, footer, figure
- Headings hierarchy (h1, h2)
- Text formatting: strong, em, u, mark
- Lists: unordered (ingredients) and ordered (instructions)
- Images with src, alt, and width attributes
- Descriptive comments and clean indentation

## Files
- `recipe.html` – the recipe page
- `images/keke-fie.jpeg` – finished dish photo
- `images/kekkfie-2.jpeg` – cooking process photo

## Submission notes
If you need to upload files:
- Submit `recipe.html`
- Submit `images/keke-fie.jpeg` and `images/kekkfie-2.jpeg`
- Keep the `images/` folder next to `recipe.html` so images resolve correctly

Optional: Rename `recipe.html` to `index.html` if you want the demo at `https://ikemike01.github.io/html-recipe/`.
