# HTML Recipe Assignment – Keke Fieye (Ijaw Plantain Pottage)

This is my submission for the AltSchool HTML recipe page assignment. I built a simple recipe site for Keke Fieye (an authentic Ijaw dish made with unripe plantains).

Live page: https://ikemike01.github.io/html-recipe/recipe.html

## What I built
- Document structure: HTML5 doctype, html/head/body, title, meta (charset + viewport)
- Content sections:
	- Header with h1 and short description
	- "Recipe Information" (h2) with prep time, cook time, servings, difficulty
	- "Ingredients" (h2) using an unordered list (11 items)
	- "Instructions" (h2) using an ordered list (6 clear steps)
	- "Tips & Notes" (h2)
- Images: two images (finished dish + process) with src, alt, and width; files live in `images/`
- Text formatting: used strong, em, u, and mark where appropriate
- Semantic HTML: header, main, article, section, figure, footer
- Comments + indentation: I added comments above major sections and kept the markup indented for readability

## How to view
- Online (recommended): open the live link above
- Locally: open `recipe.html` in a browser. Make sure the `images/` folder sits next to `recipe.html` so the pictures load.

## Files I’m submitting
- `recipe.html`
- `images/keke-fie.jpeg`
- `images/kekkfie-2.jpeg`

Notes: The recipe uses unripe plantains (authentic method). Beans are optional if you want more substance. Footer text is kept simple.
